### 6. What does the following error message tell you?
```
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```
When the user called the calculate_product method, he/she used the wrong number of arguments that does not match the number of parameters the method defined. There should be two arguments but there is only one.
